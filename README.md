# DSA-Question.
#### 1. Find the kth largest element in the given array.
#### 2. Given a sorted array arr[] and a number x, write a function that counts the occurrences of x in arr[].
#### 3. Given an array arr[] of non-negative integers and an integer sum, find a subarray that adds to a given sum. There may be more than one subarray with sum as the given sum, print first such subarray.
#### 4. An array contains both positive and negative numbers in random order. Rearrange the array elements so that all negative numbers appear before all positive numbers.
#### 5. Given an array of N integers, and an integer K, the task is to find the number of pairs of integers in the array whose sum is equal to K.
#### 6. Given an unsorted array of N integers, find smallest and largest element in optimal way.
#### 7. Rotate the array left N times. Accept N value from the user.
#### 8. How do you check if two strings are anagrams of each other?
#### 9. Reverse a string using recursion.
#### 10. Given a string, find the first non-repeated character in it. If no such character exists, return a specific value (e.g., a special character or -1) to indicate that no non-repeated character is found.
#### 11. You are given a string S, the task is to reverse the string word by word.
#### 12. You're given a string S,  consisting of "{", "}", "(", ")", "[" and "]". Return true is S is balanced, else return false.
#### 13. Given a Roman numeral, the task is to find its corresponding decimal value.
#### 14. Given a string of lowercase alphabets, count all possible substrings (not necessarily distinct) that has exactly k distinct characters.
#### 15. Check whether two string are isomorphic. Note: Two strings are isomorphic if one-to-one mapping is possible for every character of first string to every character of second string while preserving the orders of the characters.
#### 16. Find the GCD (Greatest Common Divisor) of 2 integers. The GCD of any 2 numbers is the largest number that divides both the integers.
#### 17. Given a number N, figure out if it is a member of the fibonacci series or not. Return true if the number of members of the fibonacci series else false.
#### 18. You are given two positive numbers N and M. You have to return the Nth root of M. If the Nth root of M is not an integer, return -1. Nth root of an integer M is a number, which, raised to the power N, gives M as a result
#### 19. Given an array, print the Next Greater Element (NGE) for every element. Input: arr[] = [ 4 , 5 , 2 , 25 ]
#### 20. Given a sequence of n strings, the task is to check if any two similar words come together and then destroy each other then print the number of words left in the sequence after this pairwise destruction.
#### 21. Given a stack with push(), pop(), and empty() operations, The task is to delete the middle element of it without using any additional data structure.
#### 22. Given a string with brackets. If the start index of the open bracket is given, find the index of the closing bracket.
#### 23. Given an integer k and a queue of integers, The task is to reverse the order of the first k elements of the queue, leaving the other elements in the same relative order
#### 24. Given an array and a positive integer k, find the first negative integer for each window(contiguous subarray) of size k. If a window does not contain a negative integer, then print 0 for that window.
#### 25. You are given a binary tree. A binary tree is considered balanced if the heights of the two subtrees of any node never differ by more than 1. Write a code to determine if a given binary tree is balanced or not.
